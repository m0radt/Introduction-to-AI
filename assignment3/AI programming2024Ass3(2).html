<H3>Goals </H3>
<P>
Probabilistic reasoning using 
Bayes networks, with scenarios similar to the
MAPD problem environment of assignment 1.

<H3>Uncerain MAPD Problem - Domain Description</H3>

<P>

As they try to find their best path, in the real world, robots may be unable
to tell in advance  where there packages to be delivered and which fragile edges are blocked, if any.
There may be evidence which can help, but one cannot be sure until
the vertex in question is observed by visiting it,
an edge is observed from an adjacent vertex.

Not knowing the blockages and
package locations in advance makes it hard
to plan an optimal path, so reasoning about the unknown is crucial.
We know that it is more likely for edges near package locations to be blocked due to Murphy's law,
and packages are more likely to appear at times of high demand.
In this version of the problem, we will consider only binary-valued occupation
of vertices, i.e. whether it contains a package, or not.
<P>
Thus we have a binary random variable B(e)
standing in for blockage at fragile edge e,
one binary random variable D(v) standing in for "package to be delivered at v" for each vertex v,
and a 3-valued variable S standing for the "season": low, medium, and high demand.
The package events are assumed independent given the season, with known distributions given
season. In the input we are given for each vertex that a probablity that it contains a package given low demand. 
This probability is doubled for medium demand, and tripled for high demand
(up to a maximum of 1 obviously).

The edge variables are noisy-or distributed given the packages at neighboring vertices,
with qi specified in the input. There is also global "leakage probability" specified in the input.
<P>
All in all, you have 3 types of variables (BN nodes): blockages (one for each edge)
season (only one global variable) and package present (one for each vertex).
<P>

In your program, a file specifies the geometry (size of grid and blocked and fragile edges), and parameters such as P(B(v)=true)|low demand).
Then, you enter some locations where blockages, or packages are 
reported either present or absent (and the rest remain unknown), or the season.
This is the evidence in the problem.

Once evidence is instantiated, you need to perform reasoning about the likely locations of 
blockages, and packages, and the season (all probabilities below "given the evidence"):

<OL>
<LI> What is the probability that each of the vertices contains packages?
<LI> What is the probability that each of the edges is blocked?
<LI> What is the distribution of the season variable?
<LI> What is the probability that a certain path (set of edges) is free from blockages?
(Note that the distributions of blockages in edges are NOT necessarily independent.) (bonus)
<LI> What is the path from a given location to a goal that has the highest probability of
being free from blockages? (bonus)
</OL>

<P>
Input can be as an ASCII
file, similar to graph descriptions in previous assignments, for example:

<pre>
#X 1                ; Maximum x coordinate
#Y 1                ; Maximum y coordinate

#B 0 0 1 0          ; Edge from (0,0) to (1,0) is always blocked
#F 1 0 1 1 0.8      ; Edge from (1,0) to (1,1) is fragile, with p = 1-qi = 0.8
#V 1 0 F 0.2    ; Vertex (1,0) probability of package given low demand season 0.2
#V 1 1 F 0.3    ; Vertex (1,1) probability package given low demand  0.3
              ; Either assume package probability 0 by default,
              ; or make sure to specify this probability for all vertices.
#L 0.1        ; Global leakage probability 0.1
#S 0.1 0.4 0.5 ; Prior distribution over season: 0.1 for low, 0.4 for medium, 0.5 for high
</pre>


<P>
 
<H3>Requirements </H3>

<P>
(Part I) Your program should read the data, including the distribution
parameters, which are defined as above.
The program should construct a Bayes network according
to the scenario.
The program should also allow for an output of the Bayes network constructed
for the scenario.

<P>
For example, part of the output for the above graph would be:
<pre>
SEASON:
  P(low) = 0.1
  P(medium) = 0.4
  P(high) = 0.5
	
VERTEX (1,0):
  P(package|low) = 0.2
  P(package|medium) = 0.4
  P(package|high) = 0.6

EDGE (1,0) (1,1)
  P(blocked|no package (1,0), no package (1,1)) = 0.1
  P(blocked|no package (1,0), package (1,1)) = 0.8
  P(blocked|package (1,0), no package (1,1)) = 0.8
  P(blocked|package (1,0), package (1,1)) = 0.96

VERTEX (1,1):
etc.
</pre>

<P>
(Part II) After the network is fully constructed, you should support querying the
user for a set of evidence. We do this
by reading one piece of evidence at a time (e.g. "Blockage reported at edge (1,0) (1,1)", and then
"Package reported at vertex (1,1)" etc.).
The online interactive operations your program  should support are:
<IL>
<LI> Reset evidence list to empty.
<LI> Add piece of evidence to evidence list.
<LI> Do probabilistic reasoning according to items 1, 2, 3, above (also items 4 or 5 if youe are doing the bonus part), 
and report the results.
<LI> Quit.
</IL>

<P>
Probabilistic reasoning should be done
in order to answer the questions on
distribution of blockages, etc., and report on the answers,
including all the posterior probabilities. 

You may use any algorithm in the literature that supports solution of
BNs, including simple enumerarion,
variable elimination, polytree propagation, or sampling.

<LI> Non-trivial example runs on at least 2 scenarios,
including the input and output.
<LI> Submit makefile and short description on how to run your program.
 i.e. how what  parameters are passed to the program and how 
other inputs including 
at least one full example on how to run your program with actual input.
